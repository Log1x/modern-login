Here lives a simple `mu-plugin` to whitelabel and modernize `wp-login.php`. No admin panels, no bloat â€“ just a simple filter to optionally customize the CSS properties with your color palette.

## Requirements

- [PHP](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/install.php) >= 7.1.3
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/)

## Installation

### Bedrock

Install via Composer:

```bash
$ composer require log1x/modern-login
```

### Manual

Download the release `.zip` and install into `wp-content/plugins`.

## Customization

To customize the color palette, simply pass an array containing one or more of the colors you would like to change to the `login_color_palette` filter:

```php
add_filter('login_color_palette', function () {
    return [
        'brand' => '#0073aa',
        'trim' => '#181818',
        'trim-alt' => '#282828',
    ];
});
```

Text color will automatically be inverted to `#fff` or `#111` determined by the [relative luminance](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/relative-luminance.xml) of the element's background color.

### Changing the Logo

The logo uses the first letter of the login header text set by WordPress. You can customize this using the [`login_headertext`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/login_headertext/) filter:

```php
/**
 * Change the WordPress login header to the blog name.
 *
 * @return string
 */
add_filter('login_headertext', function () {
    return get_bloginfo('name');
});
```

## Development

Modern Login is built using TailwindCSS and compiled with Laravel Mix.

```bash
$ yarn
```

In order to ease development, Modern Login makes use of [`wp-env`](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/HEAD/packages/env#readme) to quickly setup a WordPress instance with everything needed (this requires Docker).

```bash
$ npx wp-env start
```

In another terminal tab/window, you can start browser sync and webpack to watch for changes:

```bash
$ yarn start
```

You can test color values and other settings in `tests/mu-plugins/mu.php`.
